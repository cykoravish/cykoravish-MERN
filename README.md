# MERN Stack Website

## Overview

Welcome to our MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack website! This is a fancy term for a website that uses cool technologies to work smoothly. My goal is to make it awesome for you, whether you're clicking around or handling complex tasks.

## Backend Technologies

- **Node.js and Express.js:** These are like the engine of our website, making everything run smoothly and efficiently.
- **bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken:** Think of these as our security guards. They make sure only the right people can access certain areas and do specific things.
- **Zod:** This helps us organize and check the information coming in and out, making sure it's correct and safe.
- **Mongoose:** Imagine this as the translator between our website and the place where we store all our data, like a really smart friend.
- **dotenv:** This is like a secret keeper, making sure all our sensitive information is safe and sound.

## Frontend Technologies

- **React Vite:** This is our creative space, where we build the look and feel of the website quickly and efficiently.
- **Toaster:** Like a friendly pop-up friend, it shows you nice and easy-to-understand messages.
- **React Router DOM:** This helps you smoothly move around the different parts of our website, like magic teleportation!
- **React Icons:** These are the cool icons you see, making things look great and helping you understand what's going on.

## Admin Functionality

While we've made a super cool admin area on the engine side, we're still working on connecting it to the creative side. You can be a superhero and help us build an awesome admin panel! We'd love your ideas and contributions to make it even better.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** To make sure everything works, type `npm install` in both the server and client areas.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:** In the main folder, create a special file called `.env` to keep our secrets safe.
3. **Start the Server:** Type `npm run dev` in the main folder to start the server side.
4. **Start the Client:** Go into the client folder (`cd client`) and type `npm run dev` to start the client side.

Feel free to explore and help us make this MERN stack website even more fantastic! Thank you for being part of our exciting journey in creating something awesome!
